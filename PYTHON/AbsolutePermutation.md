### [Absolute Permutation](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/absolute-permutation/problem)

## Explanation:
This code is a Python program that calculates the absolute permutation of a given list of numbers for multiple test cases. Here's how it works:

1. The program defines a function `absolutePermutation()` that takes two integers `n` and `k` as input and returns a list of `n` integers representing the absolute permutation of the numbers from 1 to `n`, if possible.
2. The function creates a list `numList` of numbers from 1 to `n+1` and checks if an absolute permutation is possible using a series of if-else statements and for loops. If it is, the function returns the list of numbers in the new order. Otherwise, it returns [-1].
3. The program takes an integer `t` as input from the user, representing the number of test cases.
4. It then enters a for loop that iterates over each test case and calls the `absolutePermutation()` function to calculate the result. The program prints the result for each test case.

Is there anything else you would like to know?
## Time and Space Complexity:
### `Time Complexity:`
The time complexity of this code is O(t*n) because it iterates over `t` test cases and calls the `absolutePermutation()` function for each test case, which has a time complexity of O(n) because it iterates over each number in the input list once to calculate the result.

### `Space Complexity:`
 The space complexity is O(n) because it uses a list of size n+1 to store intermediate results.
 
## Code:
```python
def absolutePermutation(n, k):
    """
    This function takes two integers n and k as input and returns a list of n integers representing the absolute permutation
    of the numbers from 1 to n, if possible. An absolute permutation is defined as a permutation of the numbers from 1 to n
    where each number i in the permutation is at a distance of k from i in the original list.
    If there is no absolute permutation possible, it returns [-1].
    """
    
    # Create a list of numbers from 1 to n+1
    numList = list(range(n+1))
    
    # If k is 0, the original list is already an absolute permutation
    if k == 0:
        return numList[1:]
    
    # If n is odd, there can be no absolute permutation
    if n % 2 != 0:
        return [-1]
    
    # For i from 1 to n-k, swap the numbers i and i+k if their difference is k
    for i in range(1,n-k+1):
        if numList[i] + k == numList[i+k]:
            numList[i],numList[i+k] = numList[i+k],numList[i]
        # If the difference between i and numList[i] is not equal to k, there can be no absolute permutation
        elif abs(numList[i]-i) != k:
            return [-1]
    
    # For i from n-k+1 to n, if the difference between i and numList[i] is not equal to k, there can be no absolute permutation
    for i in range(n-k+1,n+1):
        if abs(numList[i]-i) != k:
            return [-1]
    
    # If an absolute permutation is possible, return the list of numbers from 1 to n in the new order
    return numList[1:]

# Take input from the user
t = int(input())

# For each test case, call the absolutePermutation function and print the result
for i in range(t):
    n , k = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    res = absolutePermutation(n,k)
    print(" ".join(map(str,res)))
