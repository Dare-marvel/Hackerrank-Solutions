### [Maximize It!](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/maximize-it/problem?isFullScreen=false)

## Explanation:
The main logic of the code can be summarized in the following points:
1. The code takes input for `num_lists` and `modulus_value` on the first line.
2. It then takes `num_lists` more lines of input where each line starts with an integer `n` followed by `n` integers. These `n` integers are stored in a list and appended to a list `input_lists`.
3. The code then calculates the Cartesian product of all the lists in `input_lists` using the `itertools.product` function.
4. For each tuple in the Cartesian product, it calculates the sum of squares of all the elements in the tuple and takes its modulus with `modulus_value`.
5. The maximum value of this modulus is stored in the variable `max_modulus` and printed at the end.

## Time and Space Complexity:
### `Time Complexity`:
The time complexity of this code is O(k * n^k) where k is the number of lists and n is the maximum length of any list. This is because the code calculates the Cartesian product of k lists which takes O(n^k) time and then iterates over each tuple in the Cartesian product which takes O(k * n^k) time.

### `Space Complexity`:
The space complexity of this code is O(k * n) where k is the number of lists and n is the maximum length of any list. This is because the code stores k lists each of maximum length n in memory.

## Code:
```py
import itertools

# Take input for number of lists and modulus value
line = input()
num_lists = int(line.split()[0])
modulus_value = int(line.split()[1])

# Initialize list to store input lists
input_lists = []
for i in range(num_lists):
    # Take input for each list
    lst = input().split()
    # Convert input strings to integers
    lst = [int(n) for n in lst]
    # Skip first element as it represents the number of integers in the list
    lst = lst[1:]
    # Append list to input lists
    input_lists.append(lst)

# Calculate Cartesian product of all input lists
cartesian_product = list(itertools.product(*input_lists))

# Initialize maximum modulus value
max_modulus = 0
for item in cartesian_product:
    # Calculate sum of squares of elements in tuple
    sum_of_squares = 0
    for num in item:
        sum_of_squares += num**2
    # Calculate modulus of sum of squares with given modulus value
    modulus = sum_of_squares % modulus_value
    # Update maximum modulus value if necessary
    if (modulus > max_modulus):
        max_modulus = modulus

# Print maximum modulus value
print(max_modulus)

```
